## Synopsis
A pitiful attempt at a street craps game.

## Motivation

To help me learn some C++ basics outside of canned examples in books.

## TODO

Add input validation on player responses.
Add limit on odds bets to 3 x ante.
Add a check to see if player has enough money to ante.
Add a game pot and payout from this pot.

## Installation

Just compile it using g++, for example. g++ Player.h Player.cpp Game.h Game.cpp main.cpp -o craps

## Contributors

Just a learning path for me right now.

## License

Um, not sure.
