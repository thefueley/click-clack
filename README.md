## Synopsis
A pitiful attempt at a street craps game.

## Motivation

To help me learn some C++ basics outside of canned examples in books.

## TODO

Add input validation on player responses.  
Add limit on odds bets to 3 x ante.  
Add a check to see if player has enough money to ante.  
Add screen updates using ncurses ... One day.

## Installation

Just compile it using g++, for example. g++ machine.h machinestates.h machine.cpp machinestate.cpp  main.cpp -o craps

## Contributors

Just a learning path for me right now.
